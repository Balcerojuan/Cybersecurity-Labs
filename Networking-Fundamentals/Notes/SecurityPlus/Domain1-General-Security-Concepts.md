# Security+ Domain 1 – General Security Concepts

## CIA Triad
- Confidentiality: protect data (encryption, passwords).
- Integrity: keep data accurate (hashes, signatures).
- Availability: keep systems online (backups, redundancy).

## Types of Controls
- Preventive: firewalls, access controls.
- Detective: IDS, logs.
- Corrective: restore backups, patch systems.

## Risk Concepts
- Threat = potential danger (hacker, malware).
- Vulnerability = weakness (unpatched system).
- Likelihood × Impact = Risk.

## Authentication vs Authorization
- AuthN = prove identity (password, fingerprint).
- AuthZ = permissions after login.
- Rule: AuthN happens before AuthZ.

## Principle of Least Privilege
- Give only the access needed, nothing more.
